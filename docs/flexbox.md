# FlexBox

**Flex is a set of rules for automatically stretching multiple columns and rows of content across a parent container.It can be used to slice and dice your site UI into a responsive layout with relative ease if you know all the right properties.**

**If an item has no HTML elements its content itself is counted as an item. In many cases it's often basic text, a single word, an image or emojis.**

**You can turn flex items into containers. Items sometimes contain content, not more items. Properties justify-items and justify-content in this case apply to content.**

## display: flex
**To enable Flex box, apply display: flex to your HTML element.**

## flex-direction:
**You can define the directional flow of items within their parent container.**
    
### flex-direction: row
**This is the default setting.**
